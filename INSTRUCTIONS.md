# Usage Instructions For P3tray.MSG

To use repl chat in repl.it, save it as a bookmarklet. A bookmarklet is basically a bookmark that on click executes some javascript code, in this case adding the repl chat window to repl.it.

1. Create a new bookmark (name it whatever you want)
2. In the url section, copy and paste this:
```
javascript:!function(){const t=document.createElement("script");t.id="repl_chat_script",t.src="https://repl-chat.p3tray.repl.co/use/bookmark.min.js",document.body.appendChild(t)}();
```
3. Now, when you are on repl.it, if you want to add the repl chat window, simply click on the bookmark!

If you really wanted to, you could use the browser client here: http://msg.p3tray.tk which still works, but why would you bother?
